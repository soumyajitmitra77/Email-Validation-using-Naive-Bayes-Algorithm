To run a .ipynb file on your computer, you'll need to have Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents containing live code, equations, visualizations, and explanatory text. Here are the steps to run a .ipynb file:

Install Anaconda:
If you don't have Jupyter Notebook installed, it's recommended to install Anaconda, which includes Jupyter Notebook along with many popular Python libraries. Download Anaconda from the official website [](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

Open Jupyter Notebook:
Once you have Anaconda installed, open Anaconda or launch Jupyter Notebook.

Download the .ipynb file:
Download the 'Email_Validation_NB .ipynb' file.

Upload the .ipynb file to Jupyter Notebook:
In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the folder where your .ipynb file is located.

Open the .ipynb File:
Click on the .ipynb file's name to open it in Jupyter Notebook.

Execute the Notebook:
Inside Jupyter Notebook, you'll see the content of your .ipynb file, including code cells. To execute a code cell, click on the cell and press Shift + Enter. This will run the code in that cell, and you'll see the output, if any, displayed below the cell.
